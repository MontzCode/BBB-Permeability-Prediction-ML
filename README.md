# BBB-Permeability-Prediction-ML

# Overview

This project predicts Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) permeability of drug compounds using machine learning models. It utilizes molecular descriptors extracted from the SMILES notation of chemical compounds to classify their BBB permeability. The project implements a full pipeline for data preprocessing, feature extraction, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation with classifiers like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, and Logistic Regression.
